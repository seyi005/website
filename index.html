                  <h2>Expectations</h2> <p>I have learned something about life all though which i had little experience, has time goes on i will understand life, this life is all about knowing what you are capable of, set out boundaries, this life is all about letting go, why i think most people find hard to be where they want to be or achieve their goals is because there are not letting go of things exspecially what has happened in the past like mostly relationships issues in relationships which may lead to suicide and violated behaviours, there are other things like peer group influence you have a goal and your friends are convincing you about that goal you want to achieve. 
                    What i have in mind to say is not having friends because that is mostly the cause of some people lifes and am not saying you shouldn't have friends but limit the friends you have so as to focus on your goals not only your goals but working on your strenght and weakness drop the one's who are holding you down if not adding any value to you and work with the intelligent one's so as to improve physically and mentally.
                  i have something for you guys today and it all about the 5 things you should keep quiet about.
                <p> 5 things to keep quiet about are;
                  <ol><li>Your goal or plan</li>
                      <li>Your love live</li>
